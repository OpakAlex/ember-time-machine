Say you are building a form, whatâ€™s the best way to handle the state of an underlying model? How do you revert unwanted changes? Do you use a buffer or take snapshots? What if your model has relationships, and those relationships have relationships?

While Ember is a leading framework for building ambitious applications, it lacks the important ability to manage complex object state. Introducing Ember Time Machine, an addon that challenges this current issue and its limitations with a single command solution.

## Features

- Single line of code to start
- Support for both Ember Objects and Arrays, as well as, Ember Data models
- Tracks nested relational changes out of the box (including `hasMany` and `belongsTo` relationships)
- Ability to revert array manipulations as well as object property changes
- No buffer used so all changes are made on the actual model
- Intelligently batches property changes when undoing and redoing

## Installation

```
ember install ember-time-machine
```

## Usage

### Objects

__Setup__

```javascript
import TimeMachine from 'ember-time-machine';

const content = Ember.Object.create({
  firstName: 'Offir'
});

const timeMachine = TimeMachine.Object.create({ content });
```

__Manipulate__

```javascript
timeMachine.get('firstName'); // --> 'Offir'
timeMachine.set('lastName', 'Golan');
```

__Undo & Redo__

```javascript
timeMachine.get('lastName'); // --> 'Golan'
timeMachine.undo();
timeMachine.get('lastName'); // --> undefined
timeMachine.redo();
timeMachine.get('lastName'); // --> 'Golan'
```

### Arrays

__Setup__

```javascript
import TimeMachine from 'ember-time-machine';

const timeMachine = TimeMachine.Array.create({ content: Ember.A([ 'offir' ]) });
```

__Manipulate__

```javascript
timeMachine.get('firstObject'); // --> 'Offir'
timeMachine.pushObject('Golan');
```

__Undo & Redo__

```javascript
timeMachine.objectAt(1); // --> 'Golan'
timeMachine.undo();
timeMachine.objectAt(1); // --> undefined
timeMachine.redo();
timeMachine.objectAt(1); // --> 'Golan'
```

## Options

#### ignoredProperties ( _Array_ )

Properties that will be ignored by the time machine. Supports nested keys including `@each`

```javascript
const ignoredProperties = ['someProp', 'obj.array.@each.somProp'];

const objectMachine = TimeMachine.Object.create({ content, ignoredProperties });

const arrayMachine = TimeMachine.Array.create({ content, ignoredProperties });
```

#### frozenProperties ( _Array_ )

Properties that will not be modified. Supports nested keys including `@each`

```javascript
const content = Ember.Object.create({ array: Ember.A() });
const frozenProperties = ['someProp', 'array', 'obj.array.@each.somProp'];

const timeMachine = TimeMachine.Object.create({ content, frozenProperties });

timeMachine.set('someProp', 'foo');
timeMachine.get('someProp'); // --> undefined

timeMachine.set('someOtherProp', 'bar');
timeMachine.get('someOtherProp'); // --> 'bar'

timeMachine.get('array').pushObject('baz');
timeMachine.get('array').objectAt(0); // --> undefined
```

#### maxDepth ( _Number_ )

The Max nested level to track changes emitted by children of the receiver.
If set to `-1`, all nested children will be tracked.

__Default: -1__

```javascript
// Only track root level changes made by the receiver
const objectMachine = TimeMachine.Object.create({ content,  maxDepth: 0 });

// Track changes up to 2 levels deep ( model.friends.firstName )
const objectMachine = TimeMachine.Object.create({ content,  maxDepth: 2 });
```

#### shouldWrapValue ( _Function_ )

_Params:_

  - value ( __Unknown__ ): The value that will be wrapped
  - timeMachine ( __TimeMachine__ ): The current Time Machine that this value belongs under
  - key ( __String__ ): The object's key that the value came from

Currently, any value of type `instance`, `object`, and `array` (via Ember.typeOf) will automatically be wrapped in their
own Time Machine. If you don't want specific values to be wrapped, this is the place to do it.

```javascript
const shouldWrapValue = function(value, timeMachine, key) {
  return !(value instanceof moment) || key.indexOf('foo') !== -1;
}

const objectMachine = TimeMachine.Object.create({ content, shouldWrapValue });
```

## API
